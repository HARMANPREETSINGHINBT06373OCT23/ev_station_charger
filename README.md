- Charger listing with filters and CRUD operations.
- Map view displaying chargers on Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, with clickable markers.

**Deployment:**

- Backend and frontend deployed on any cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, Vercel, Render, Firebase Hosting).
- Public API endpoint accessible for testing.

**Deliverables:**

- GitHub repo with backend and frontend folders and README.
- Deployed frontend URL.
- Backend API URL (optional Swagger/Postman collection).
